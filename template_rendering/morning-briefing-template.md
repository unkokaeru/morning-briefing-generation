### 'le' Games

Starting with the infamous [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), moving onto its counterpart [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr), and a similar [Globle](https://globle-game.com)! Then, a [Chessle](https://jackli.gg/chessle/) could be fun before completing a slightly different [animal naming game](https://metazooa.com).

BUT, the other NYT games are pretty fun too, so complete them [here](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords). Oh, there's also new one called [Minecraftle](https://minecraftle.zachmanson.com) - check it out!

### Typing

Win a quick [Typeracer match](https://play.typeracer.com), type out a [page of Metamorphosis](https://www.typelit.io/typing-console/Metamorphosis), and test your overall typing speed on [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com).

### Maths

Let's slowly complete some [International Maths Olympiad](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=IMO%20Questions%2Fmds%2Fmds) questions! Do as many as you want, but at least one.

Next, combine maths with programming with a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives)!

### Japanese learning

Well... you want to learn Japanese. So, make sure you keep on top of your [kana](https://kana-quiz.tofugu.com) and [kanji](https://www.wanikani.com/dashboard) studies!

Eventually, start going over the Genki books, too.

### Sudoku

Here's today's [Sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/today.shtml)! Maybe you'll have to learn some new techniques to solve this one, who knows!

## That's it for today!
